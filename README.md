# Project-4
Git Repository for Metis Project -4 

### Inspiration behind this project:
Analyze the history of America by analyzing the trends from the speeches of Presidents. I performed topic modeling and then walked back in time to connect the topics with the relevant historical context.   

### Key questions:
* Which all topics I could model based on the data. 
* Polarity/Subjectivity analysis of the President Speeches.

### Files : 

* Project-4.ipynb - This has all the code that I have used as part of project -4. 
* Metis Project -4_Final.pdf - Presentation.

### Tools :

* Pandas 
* Tableau
* IBM ToneAnalyzer V3

### Data Source : 

The data has been sourced from Kaggle :https://www.kaggle.com/littleotter/united-states-presidential-speeches. It has the presidential speeches until September 9th, 2019. There are around 992 speeches which range from 1789-04-30 to 2019-09-25 .
